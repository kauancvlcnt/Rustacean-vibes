# Rustacean-vibes
<h2>This is my repository to learn rust</h2>

***
I declare that the comments are not formal texts and have no commitment to be written correctly in Portuguese. I make the comments because they help me understand more efficiently what each piece of code does. At first they will be present. However, as I become more fluent in Rust, I will abandon most of them and all the lines of code will be implicit in my head.
